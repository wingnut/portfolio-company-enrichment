The portfolio consists of original brands with strong market positions and comprises both prescription drugs (Rx) as well as consumer products (OTC) within seven distinct categories - Skin Health, Intimate Health, Digestive Health, Foot Health, Wellness, Pain, Cough \u0026 Cold and Specialty products. Karo Healthcare\u0027s products have a strong position in the Nordic regions and the company has successfully expanded its direct distributions network to several other countries in Western Europe both through organic growth and acquisitions. Overall, Karo Healthcare\u0027s products are sold to sixty different markets worldwide. Karo Healthcare was founded in 1987 and is headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden.  Market trends and drivers  The large specialty pharmaceutical market demonstrates stable growth over the cycles and high resilience during economic downturns. The market offers attractive growth opportunities, both organically driven by underlying patient-critical demand, and inorganically through a generally high M\u0026A activity as a result of the continued consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry. Investment potential  Accelerate organic growth in existing portfolio through commerical and digital focus, primarily on larger \"Hero\" brands with international presence and potential. Continue consolidating the fragmented speciality pharma and consumer health market by acquiring pan-European brands in core categories with growth potential, targeting attractive organic growth outlook at exit. Increase share of OTC in the overall portfolio. Drive operational improvements including increasing gross margin through CMO and logistics consolidation, as well as driving operating leverage while strengthening Karo Healthcare\u0027s organization and capabilities."},"fundData":[{"path":"/current-portfolio/funds/eqt-viii/","title":"EQT VIII","preamble":"EQT VIII makes control equity investments as well as significant influence investments in companies with strong market positions, significant potential for revenue and earnings growth, strong cash flows and a solid platform that can retain and attract high-quality management.
